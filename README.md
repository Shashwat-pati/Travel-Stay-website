Travel & Stay Website- Udaan
ðŸ”¹A frontend application which can be used to develop a Full Stack website for travel geeks & vloggers.
ðŸ”¹I have designed the website using `React.js` & used `Aos Module` which is an animation-providing JavaScript library that makes it easier to add tons of animations by simply changing the name of the class in the div tag in which you want to add an animation.
ðŸ”¹Used `Material UI` & `IconScout` for better UI designing.
ðŸ”¹Learnt the use of `create-react-app` for viewing the website locally on the developer end.
ðŸ”¹The app shows various functionalities such as popular destination,accomodation,special offers on selected Hotels & Blogs about various places.
